# Character-Selection-System
A solution for a player to choose their character before entering a game

This is a simple mechanism for choosing a playable character in any game. The player can rotate a platform to bring a character to forground and then select the highlitghed character. When a character is selected the player proceeds to the main scene of the game where the selected character is spawned.

The project makes use of hashtables and data persistence between scenes to maintain the player properties and character selection across the game. In making of this system, Unity Engine 2021.3.11 is used. All the assets are free lisenced and can be found online.
